FryProxy
========

Extensible man in the middle HTTP proxy with SSL support. It was written because I need a way to monitor and possibly stub some browser request in selenium tests. It also available as [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FryProxy/)

## Examples:

Setup HTTP proxy:

```csharp
  var httpProxyServer = new HttpProxyServer("localhost", new HttpProxy());
  httpProxyServer.Start().WaitOne();
  
  // do stuff
  
  httpProxyServer.stop();
```

Setup SSL proxy:

```csharp
  var certificate = new X509Certificate2("path_to_sertificate", "password");
  var sslProxyServer = new HttpProxyServer("localhost", new SslProxy(certificate));
  sslProxyServer.start();
  
  // do ssl stuff
  
  sslProxyServer.stop();
```

## Extension points
Request are processed in 5 stages:
- receive request from client
- connect to destination server
- send request to server and receive response
- send response back to client
- complete processing and close connections

It is possible to add additional behavior to any stage with delegates:

```csharp
  var httpProxy = new HttpProxy(){
    OnRequestReceived = context => {},
    OnServerConnected = context => {},
    OnResponseReceived = context => {},
    OnResponseSent = context => {},
    OnProcessingComplete = context => {}
  };
```

Context stores request information during processing single request. What you can possibly do with it ?
- modify request and response headers
- modify request and response body
- respond by yourself on behalf of destination server
- ...or something in between

Take a look at [console app](https://github.com/eger-geger/FryProxy/blob/master/FryProxy.ConsoleApp/src/Program.cs) and [tests](https://github.com/eger-geger/FryProxy/blob/master/FryProxy.Tests/src/Integration/InterceptionTests.cs) for usage example.
